# Java Practice Programs 

Welcome to my **Java Practice Repository**! This repository is dedicated to core Java programs that I’m building as part of my learning and practice. Each file in this repo covers a small, focused concept — from basic syntax to problem-solving and algorithm design.

##  About

This repository includes:

- Basic Java programs for practice
- Logic-based problem-solving examples
- Class and object usage in simple applications
- Programs exploring loops, conditions, arrays, and methods
- Easy-to-understand, beginner-friendly code structure

Whether you're just starting out or brushing up your Java skills, this repo can be a great reference!

## 💡 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyusha269/java.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder and compile any `.java` file:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```

## 📁 Structure

Each Java program is saved along with its compiled `.class` file. All files are organized at the root level for quick access and testing.
